''piza-shop-webservice''

The archive for the pizza shop webservice for SWE 3313. Utilizes ASP.NET Razor pages with EF and SQL for the ORM and database.

Since this is an ASP.NET project, it is impossible to simply run it as an executable. Attempt to run the project
using the provided `run-project.ps1` script.

Right click on `run-project.ps1` and click on `Run in powershell`. This will automatically start the project.

If that doesn't work, then you do not have a dotnet environment to run
the project. If the application successfully launches, and you can see logs from the server, open your browser and
connect to "https://localhost:5001" to access the website. Make sure to take note of the database file location.

A default customer account account with the phone number "1111111111" and the password "password" have been
added for your convenience.
